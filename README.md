# Caesar Cipher Encryptor and Decryptor

This Python code implements a Caesar Cipher, which is a simple encryption technique. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

## **The Code Breakdown:**

The code is divided into three functions:

1. `encrypt(message, key)`: This function takes a message and a key as input. It iterates over each character in the message and checks if it's an alphabetical character (a-z, A-Z).

   - If it is alphabetical, it performs the shift based on the key value. 
     - It converts the character to its corresponding ASCII code.
     - It adds the key value to the ASCII code.
     - It takes the modulo 26 of the sum to handle overflow (resulting in a value between 0-25).
     - It converts the new ASCII code back to a character.

   - If the character is not alphabetical, it remains unchanged.

2. `decrypt(encrypted_message, key)`: This function works similarly to the encryption function, but it subtracts the key value from the ASCII code to shift the letters back to their original positions.

3. `main()`: This function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user for a message and a key, encrypts the message using the `encrypt` function, decrypts the encrypted message using the `decrypt` function, and then prints both the original and encrypted messages.

## **Limitations:**

This is a basic Caesar Cipher and has limitations:

- It only encrypts alphabetical characters (a-z, A-Z).
- It's not a secure encryption method, as someone can easily crack the code by trying different key values (brute-force attack).
